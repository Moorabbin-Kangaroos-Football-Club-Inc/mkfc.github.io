The North Melbourne Kangaroos (AFL club) use the following official branding elements:

**1. Primary Color Palette:**
*   **Royal Blue (Primary):** PMS 647 C / Hex #003B9B / RGB (0, 59, 155)
*   **White (Primary):** Used prominently with the royal blue. Hex #FFFFFF / RGB (255, 255, 255)
*   **Gold/Yellow (Secondary/Heritage):** PMS 116 C (or similar) / Hex #FFCD00 / RGB (255, 205, 0). This is a key accent, especially on the heritage/clash guernsey and in some branding elements reflecting the club's "Shinboner" history.

**2. Fonts/Typography:**
*   **Logo Font:** The primary "NORTH MELBOURNE" wordmark in the logo uses a **custom, proprietary typeface** designed specifically for the club. It's a bold, condensed sans-serif with distinctive angular cuts (especially on the 'R's and 'N's) and a slightly aggressive feel.
*   **Primary Brand Font (Digital/Text):** For body text, communications, and digital platforms, North Melbourne commonly uses **DIN** or a very similar clean, modern sans-serif like **Helvetica Neue**.
*   **Headline/Accent Font:** For prominent headlines and emphasis, they often use a **bold, condensed sans-serif** similar to **DIN Condensed** or **Helvetica Neue Condensed**, which echoes the strength and compactness of the logo font.

**In summary:**

*   **Colors:** Dominant **Royal Blue (PMS 647 / #003B9B)** and **White**, accented by **Gold (#FFCD00)**.
*   **Logo Font:** Unique **custom condensed sans-serif**.
